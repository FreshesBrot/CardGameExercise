# CardGameExercise
A C++ card game exercise that features a framework to implement Card Games that can be played on the command line.

**Working Period: 09/20 - 10/20**

This exercise includes:
 - Creating an easy framework to manipulate (e.g. shuffle) a deck of cards
 - Playing around with rvalue references and move semantics
 - Trying out multi-threading
 - Trying out the factory design pattern to help manage creation of commands for the command line

### Ideas for improvement
 - Use the asio library to implement multiplayer card games
 - Improve performance through better use of move semantics and optimized function calls
